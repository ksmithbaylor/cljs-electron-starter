# cljs-electron-starter

Forked from [here](https://github.com/Gonzih/cljs-electron). I added a basic testing setup, implemented dynamic restarting of the Electron app, and consolidated everything under a single `yarn start` command.

## Using

To develop:

    yarn start

To run tests:

    lein doo
